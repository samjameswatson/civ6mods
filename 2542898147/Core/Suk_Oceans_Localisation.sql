New resources, such as Seals, Squid, and Coral, now lie waiting beneath the depths, adding more variety. Coastal Luxuries are now different for every continent, so new oceans will yield new riches. Improvements and Districts, such as the Fishery and the Water Park are adjusted to account for these changes."

			"Squids belong to a particularly successful group of mollusks called cephalopods, which have been around for about 500 million years. Squid are found in oceans all around the world. Some squid prefer warmer, tropical waters while others thrive in the cold seas. Squid are rapid swimmers, moving by jet propulsion, and largely locate their prey by sight. They are among the most intelligent of invertebrates, with groups of Humboldt squid having been observed hunting cooperatively. They are preyed on by sharks, other fish, sea birds, seals and cetaceans."

			"Squid form a major food resource and are used in cuisines around the world. In English-speaking countries, squid as food is often called calamari, adopted from Italian into English in the 17th century. Squid are found abundantly in certain areas, and provide large catches for fisheries. The body can be stuffed whole, cut into flat pieces, or sliced into rings. The arms, tentacles, and ink are also edible; the only parts not eaten are the beak and gladius. Squid is a good food source for zinc and manganese, and high in copper, selenium, vitamin B12, and riboflavin."

While there are many differences among the species, all seals have feet shaped like fins. In fact, the word pinniped means “fin-footed” in Latin. Seals range greatly in size, from the gargantuan southern elephant seal, which can weigh more than a pickup truck, to the relatively slender, 100-pound Baikal seal."

			"Historically, hunters have heavily targeted pinniped species for their fur, a practice that drove some species to extinction: The Caribbean monk seal, for instance, disappeared from the planet in the 1970s. Though hunting is more regulated today, the animals still face many threats, including lack of food, entanglement in fishing gear, and conflict with fishermen. Some species, like the Hawaiian monk seal and Mediterranean monk seal, remain very close to extinction. However, climate change represents the single largest threat to many species of pinnipeds, especially those that rely on sea ice."

Harvested coral is usually cut and polished into cabochons, shaped into beads or carved. The part of coral that is used for jewelry is actually not the living organism, but rather its carbonate secretions, which form the structure that the polyps live on, and although it is not the living part of the animal, it is essential for its survival."

While some jewelers continue to use coral in their designs, many jewelers only use coral repurposed from vintage pieces and others have stopped creating coral jewelry altogether. With fewer jewelers using coral, the reefs may have a better chance of recovering. And, until then, coral lovers can buy beautiful antique coral jewelry pieces, or if they’re lucky, see coral living in the wild."

The meat is often eaten with melted butter and lemon juice. Lobster is also used in soup, bisque, lobster rolls, cappon magro, and dishes such as lobster Newberg and lobster Thermidor."

Caviar comes from several species of sturgeon, but beluga caviar is the largest, rarest, and the most expensive caviar. At close to $3,500 per pound, it deserves its nickname, “black gold.” Depending on the country, caviar may also be used to describe the roe of other fish such as salmon, steelhead, trout, lumpfish, whitefish, or carp."

			"Sturgeon populations have dwindled globally, due partly to caviar’s popularity as a luxury food item, and many locations now have strict catch limits or even bans. Other reasons for the population decline include water pollution and loss of habitat from river dams that prevent the fish from reaching their spawning grounds. Many species of sturgeon are on the endangered species list. To take pressure off of dwindling wild sturgeon populations, there are companies in 20 countries that farm sturgeon. In the vast majority of cases, eggs are removed after killing the fish. Other companies have tried a more lasting approach by rearing the fish until they’re ready to spawn, then, after removing the eggs via C-section, sewing the fish back up and rearing them for more production. The process is very hard on the fish and has been banned in several countries."
