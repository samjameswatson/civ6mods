		'In the Catholic Church, a basilica is a large and important church building designated as a basilica by the Pope and thereby distinguished for ceremonial purposes from other churches. Numerous basilicas are notable shrines, often even receiving significant pilgrimages, especially among the many that were built above a confessio or the burial place of a martyr – although this term now usually designates a space before the high altar that is sunk lower than the main floor level and that offer more immediate access to the burial places below. Originally, a basilica was an ancient Roman public building, where courts were held, as well as serving other official and public functions. They were typically rectangular buildings with a central nave flanked by two or more longitudinal aisles, with the roof at two levels, being higher in the centre over the nave to admit a clerestory and lower over the side-aisles. Basilicas in the Catholic Church, however, need not follow this architectural design to be considered basilicas.'),

		'A beth manda is a place of worship for followers of Mandaeism. Beth mandas are adorned with the darfash - a cross of olive wood half covered with a piece of white pure silk cloth and seven branches of myrtle. This cross is not identified with the Christian corss; rather, the four arms of the cross symbolize the four corners of the universe, the pure silk cloth represents the Light of God, and the seven branches of myrtle represent the seven days of creation. Inside the beth manda, followers undergo weekly baptism and a mass for the dead.'),

		'Druze prayer houses are called khalwats. This term also refers to Sufi spiritual retreats. The primary sanctuary of the Druze is at Khalwat al-Bayada, located in Lebanon. It features a large, stone, circular bench next to an ancient oak tree.'),

		'Buttō is the Japanese word for pagoda. These builings derive from the Chinese pagoda, which itself is an interpretation of the Indian stupa. Buttōs are quintessentially Buddhist and an important component of Japanese Buddhist temple compounds. There are many different forms of buttōs, and they are given different names based on their construction material and number of stories.'),

		'Derasars are places of worship for Jains. Jain architecture is essentially restricted to temples and monasteries, and secular Jain buildings generally reflect the prevailing style of the place and time they were built. Temples may be divided into Shikar-bandhi Jain temples, public dedicated temple buildings, normally with a high superstructure, typically a north Indian shikhara tower above the shrine) and the Ghar Jain temple, a private Jain house shrine. A Jain temple which is known as a pilgrimage centre is often termed a Tirtha. The main image of a Jain temple is known as a mula nayak.'),

		'Candis are Indonesian stupas. These were mostly built during the Zaman Hindu-Buddha period, between the 4th and 15th centuries. Indonesian archaeologists describe candis as sacred structures of Hindu and Buddhist heritage, used for religious rituals and ceremonies in Indonesia. However, ancient secular structures such as gates, urban ruins, pools and bathing places are often called candi too, while a shrine that specifically serves as a tomb is called a cungkup.'),

		'A serapeum is a temple dedicated to the syncretic Greco-Egyptian deity Serapis, who combined aspects of Osiris and Apis in a humanized form that was accepted by the Ptolemaic Greeks of Alexandria. One of the most important Serapea was that of Alexandria, which was built by Ptolemy III Euergetes. This temple has been referred to as "the daughter of the Library of Alexandria" and existed until the end of the 4th century.');
